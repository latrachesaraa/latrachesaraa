## 🧬 About Me

I'm a passionate **Full Stack Developer** with a strong focus on **backend architecture, system design, and scalable platforms**.  
I build robust applications that go beyond features — I design **systems**, **workflows**, and **digital infrastructures**.

I love:
- Solving complex problems  
- Designing clean architectures  
- Building real-world platforms  
- Optimizing performance  
- Creating products that scale  
- Turning chaos into structure 😌  

I combine **technical depth**, **engineering logic**, and **product thinking** to deliver high-quality software — not just code.
