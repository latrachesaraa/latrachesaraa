## 🚀 About Me

I'm **Sara Latrache**, a 26-year-old **Full Stack Developer** with a strong focus on **backend engineering, system architecture, and data-driven platforms**.  
I design and build **scalable, maintainable, production-ready systems** that solve real-world problems.

I don’t just write code — I build **products, platforms, and infrastructures**.

I combine:
- strong engineering foundations  
- clean architecture principles  
- performance-driven thinking  
- and real-world production experience  

to deliver **reliable, scalable, and future-proof systems**.
